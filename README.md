srsRAN is an open source 4G software radio suite developed by [SRS](http://www.srs.io).
See the [srsRAN 4G project pages](https://www.srsran.com) for information, guides and project news.

The srsRAN suite includes:
  * srsUE - a full-stack SDR 4G UE application with prototype 5G features
  * srsENB - a full-stack SDR 4G eNodeB application
  * srsEPC - a light-weight 4G core network implementation with MME, HSS and S/P-GW

For application features, build instructions and user guides see the [srsRAN 4G documentation](https://docs.srsran.com/projects/4g/).
